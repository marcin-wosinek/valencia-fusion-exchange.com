        <h3>12â€”14 april 2024</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Location: Valencia, Spain</li>
          <li>
            Venue: Escuela de Ruzafa: beautiful dance venue in the city center,
          </li>
          <li>Dance weekend with 3 fusion parties at night</li>
          <li>Daytime activities on Saturday and Sunday</li>
          <li>3 open level dance classes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We're excited to present a weekend full of dance, rhythm, connection
          and flowâ€¦ Join us in one of the most vibrant fusion dance communities
          in Southern Europe.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you come from far away, you will be able to enjoy both the dance
          and a wonderful tourist destination: Valencia. You will find here lots
          of sun, beautiful beaches, great cuisine, and a vibrant city center
          full of culture. You will meet other travelers exploring the city as
          well as many locals happy to recommend places worth visiting.
        </p>

        <p>
          For people from the local community, it will be a great opportunity to
          meet fusion dancers from elsewhere and experience first-hand how the
          dance is interpreted elsewhere. Youâ€™ll be able to dance to the music
          played by DJs we donâ€™t often have the chance to hear. This setting and
          occasion will make for a wonderful experience, one that will connect
          you to the broader fusion community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Weâ€™ll all enjoy a unique chance to connect through dance, meet new
          people, and experience new things. Join us, and make the magic happen!
        </p>

          offerings:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            3 night parties from at least from 20h until midnight, on Friday,
            Saturday, and Sunday
          </li>
          <li>3 open level dance classes</li>
          <li>

            picnic and dance during the day
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>
        <p>
          La Escuela de Ruzafa, a beautiful space near the center of Valencia at
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/H1hLoKTABmdSrVmXA">Calle Denia 32</a

        </p>

        <h2 id="what-is-fusion">What is fusion?</h2>

        <p>
          Fusion is a dance style focused on connection and interpreting the
          music together. We dance to a huge variety of music: sometimes music
          associated with a particular dance style, sometimes electronic music,
          sometimes hip-hop, and sometimes something entirely
          differentâ€”depending on the DJ.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are dancers coming with very different backgrounds: from blues,
          kizomba, zouk, tango, or contact improvisation. Each dance is
          different, and you can always expect to see something new.
        </p>

        <p>
          Itâ€™s a great dance for beginners as well: you donâ€™t need experience in
          dancing. You can attend without anxiety and connect to the music as
          well as your partnerâ€”and dance as you feel. Besides that, we will have
          open level classes to help you start.
        </p>

        <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of conduct</h2>
        <p>
          Respect each other and be aware that everyone has a different
          perception of limits: better err on the side of being too polite and
          too respectful. Please talk to each other: ask for permission and tell
          people if they do something you are not OK with.
        </p>

        <p>
          If someone is repeatedly disrespecting your limits, please talk to the
          <b>care team</b> or the organizers.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't assume what role youâ€™ll take in the dance; whether you lead,
            follow, or switch is up to you and your partner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check in with your partner about what kind of dance they would
            like, including whether they feel comfortable with close embraces or
            being dipped.</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            Welcome everyone, embracing queerness and all types of bodies.t
          </li>
          <li>
            If you donâ€™t want to dance with someoneâ€”just decline. You donâ€™t have
            to provide justification nor promise a dance later.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are welcome to ask anyone to dance. Be comfortable hearing no
            from time to time.
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone repeatedly declines to dance with youâ€”take a hint, and
            stop asking them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In case anything uncomfortable happens to you, or you witness anything
          that concerns you, please get in contact with your care team or the
          organizers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note!</b> If you have ever been banned from any dance community or
          event, please contact the organizer before purchasing your ticket. We
          want to make sure everybody feels safeâ€”and we would need to
          double-check if we can have you at the event. Failure to notify us can
          result in your being banned from the event.
