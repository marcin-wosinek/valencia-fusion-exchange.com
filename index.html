          played by DJs we donâ€™t often have the chance to hear. This setting and
          occasion will make for a wonderful experience, one that will connect

        <h2 id="what-is-fusion">What is fusion?</h2>

        <p>
          Fusion is a dance style focused on connection and interpreting the
          music together. We dance to a huge variety of music: sometimes music
          associated with a particular dance style, sometimes electronic music,
          sometimes hip-hop, and sometimes something entirely
          differentâ€”depending on the DJ.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are dancers coming with very different backgrounds: from blues,
          kizomba, zouk, tango, or contact improvisation. Each dance is
          different, and you can always expect to see something new.
        </p>

        <p>
          Itâ€™s a great dance for beginners as well: you donâ€™t need experience in
          dancing. You can attend without anxiety and connect to the music as
          well as your partnerâ€”and dance as you feel. Besides that, we will have
          open level classes to help you start.

          The event will be in the center of Valenciaâ€”a major tourist

          available nearbyâ€”check your usual sourcesâ€”there should be something
          for any budget.

        <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of conduct</h2>
        <p>
          Respect each other and be aware that everyone has a different
          perception of limits: better err on the side of being too polite and
          too respectful. Please talk to each other: ask for permission and tell
          people if they do something you are not OK with.
        </p>

        <p>
          If someone is repeatedly disrespecting your limits, please talk to the
          <b>care team</b> or the organizers.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't assume what role youâ€™ll take in the dance; whether you lead,
            follow, or switch is up to you and your partner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check in with your partner about what kind of dance they would like,
            including whether they feel comfortable with close embraces or being
            dipped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Welcome everyone, embracing queerness and all types of bodies.t
          </li>
          <li>
            If you donâ€™t want to dance with someoneâ€”just decline. You donâ€™t have
            to provide justification nor promise a dance later.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are welcome to ask anyone to dance. Be comfortable hearing no
            from time to time.
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone repeatedly declines to dance with youâ€”take a hint, and
            stop asking them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In case anything uncomfortable happens to you, or you witness anything
          that concerns you, please get in contact with your care team or the
          organizers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note!</b> If you have ever been banned from any dance community or
          event, please contact the organizer before purchasing your ticket. We
          want to make sure everybody feels safeâ€”and we would need to
          double-check if we can have you at the event. Failure to notify us can
          result in your being banned from the event.
